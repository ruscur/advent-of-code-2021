# Day 22

I don't like 3D space at all.

This one wasn't too bad but I ended up taking 5 hours anyway because I had
operations slightly out of order.  I never wrote a naive solution because
it was pretty obvious part 2 was just going to be "the same, but bigger"
so I needed to figure out the clever way to go about it anyway.

I basically had it solved within 2 hours and spent the remaining 3 having
things slightly wrong and getting frustrated fiddling with things.  I had
so much logic when all I actually needed was to toggle on/off.

Not a great result given how long it took, but at least I was on the right
track the whole time, so I have that going for me.  Also getting part 2
within 1 minute of finishing part 1 was kind of fun.  Also it runs in 0.1s
which is neat.

No more vector-y stuff please, my brain is bad at shapes.
