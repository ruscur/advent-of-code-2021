# Day 3

Spent very little time on this one, friday night brain fried already.

Learned the difference between `.iter()` and `.into_iter()` and how Rust deals
with binary parsing.  Extremely certain there's a much more elegant solution
but not willing to spend brain power on it at this point, looking forward to
checking out what others did though!

Another day.  Now time for brain to go sleep.
