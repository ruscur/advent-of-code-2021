# Day 4

I am in deep pain as a result of Rust not having either variable length
arrays or a 2D vector type, would've been nice instead of feeling forced
to flatten.

Felt like stumbling over Rust stuff more than just solving the problem here.

I think it's decently fast for a naive solution at least.
