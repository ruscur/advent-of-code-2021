# Advent of Code 2021

Hello, this is [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com) written in Rust.

I'm not spending too much time or effort on these so there might be a
lack of polish.  If there's something you think I could've done better
(i.e. you read my code and think "he must not know about X"), feel free
to open an issue!  The whole point is to learn and get better.

I might add a README to the individual challenges if there was something
about it I found difficult or interesting.

My main goals here are:

- write solutions that are easy enough to follow
- write idiomatic Rust, within reason
- get out of my comfort zone and do things differently to how I usually would
