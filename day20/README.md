# Day 20

Beyond happy to have an easy one today.  I started an hour late,
finished under 2 hours from time of posting, and only barely got
a better rank than yesterday's that took 9 hours.

The way of handling the current infinite value is a little sloppy,
it might actually be more elegant to calculate it outright and then
just have flip it based on odd vs even.  Either way, I liked
everything about today's puzzle.
