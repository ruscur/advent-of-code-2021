# Day 15

I *really* struggled with this one.

On the upside, it's very useful to learn about pathfinding.  I started out
working with a recursive solution but it got unwieldy, so I changed modes.
I tried to write something like Dijkstra's, but it's not a good fit for a
2d array like this.  I eventually figured out that's all way too complicated
and all I needed was the array of distances.

I'd like to know how to do something smarter so that there's no need for
repeated iterations.

Definitely going to check out how others did it, this was quite the change
of pace from the last handful that have been really quick and easy for me.

Looking at my code now it's done, it's all pretty simple and I don't know
how I took this long.  Oh well, we do this to learn.
