# Day 19

This absolutely ruined me.  I legitimately spent 9 hours on a solution I hate.

I just feel terrible.  I spent so long trying to come up with a clever solution 
before just giving up and smashing it together.

I think this highlighted to me how important it is to take breaks.  Advent of 
Code probably shouldn't be causing me to have an existential meltdown, but here
I am.

Take breaks.

I think the expectation that I do these every day, especially since they come out
at 3pm, isn't realistic when I hit something that I can't figure out quickly.
